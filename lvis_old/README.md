# Long-Tailed Object Detection and Instance Segmentation

This is the original version of our codes (based on mmdetection V1.1 and LVIS V0.5) that we used when we submitted the paper. However, both mmdetection and LVIS are soon updated to newer version and on longer provide supports to these older versions, so we re-implemented our methods on [mmdetection V2.4](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) using [LVIS V1.0](https://www.lvisdataset.org/dataset).

Please go to our [newer version of codes](../lvis1.0) for long-tailed object detection and instance segmentation.
